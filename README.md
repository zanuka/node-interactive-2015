### Convergence: Evolving Node.js with Open Governance and an Open Community

#### James Snell
(IBM’s open technologies architect)

First off was James Snell from IBM, with a presentation titled "Convergence: Evolving Node.js with Open Governance and an Open Community." Snell is IBM’s open technologies architect, and a member of the Node Core Technical Committee (CTC) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). He observed that 2015 was an interesting year for Node, with the io.js fork generating some fear, doubt, and uncertainty.  Although there was a lot of excitement around Node, he said, there was a general belief that it could be better.

With the release of Node.js v4.0.0, the node.js and io.js projects resolved their differences and came back together. During the talk, he explored the events that led up to convergence, discussed how the Node.js project has evolved, and gave insight as to how developers can get involved to help the Node.js core continue to grow and mature.

Even more exciting is what’s happening in the ecosystem: npm module counts started increasing and npm downloads have gone up dramatically. Snell finished by saying he’s excited to see how people leverage Node to build great things in the coming year.

# The World is being Reinvented in Code
Jason Gartner - vice-president of Interactive Services development, IBM

Started with a question: Why is IBM interested in Node, and how are we taking it forward? The answer, in a word (or rather, an acronym) is APIs. According to polls, the top use cases for Node are REST APIs and realtime services.

The next killer app, he said, isn’t going to be an app, its going to be an API, specifically a REST API. Every company is transforming into a digital business for which APIs are critically important to interact with customers, vendors, partners, and more. IBM refers to this as the "API economy." By 2018, he said, the API economy will be worth $2.2 trillion.

### IBM's focus on Node.js in 2015
- Acquiring StrongLoop.
- Continuing its support of the Node developer community.
- Working to bring Java and Node communities together to promote innovation.
- Expanding the number connectors to legacy systems where data currently resides.
- Making Node solutions available on IBM Bluemix and projects from Bluemix garage.

# Node.js at Uber
Tom Croucher - engineering manager, Uber

Tom spoke about his experiences using Node at Uber. He started by saying he likes the amount of power Node gives him and the things it enables him to do quickly and easily. Then he noted that the bulk of Uber’s $50 billion business is based on Node.js technology. Uber works because it’s a platform, he said, and that is largely enabled by Node.

He said "Let’s be real: Node is just an event loop with bits of JavaScript bolted on."

He recommended that everyone read Steve Yegge’s "platform rant" from 2001 that compares how things are done at Google and Amazon.

He also noted that Uber loves open source and contributing to the open source community. See http://uber.github.io/ for a list of projects.

# Node.js and npm by Numbers
Ashley Williams - developer community and content manager, npm

Every day around 1.8 million npm install events occur. Since each of these events downloads an average of 70 packages, that means that people download 126 million packages per day using npm.

She explained that npm is a package manager tool, but it’s also a community engagement tool. It creates a nexus of participants:

• Installers who want to download packages
• Packages that can take on a life of their own
• Publishers who write and publish code to the npm registry

In the last year, npm has served over 19 billion package downloads, over half of those in last three months. It has over 200,000 packages, each with an average of six versions, which gives it 1.2 million package versions. This makes it the largest package manager in the world.

Node’s success depends on its growth into the enterprise, and **"open source is the largest enterprise"** and concluded by saying they are excited to enable more, and more diverse, developers to collaborate and are humbled to be a part of Node’s success.

# Serving the Node.js Enterprise, Thus Serving the Community
Joe McCann, NodeSource

Finally Joe McCann, the CEO of NodeSource, spoke about the Node community and how to grow it.

He asked "How can we double the size of the Node community in one year?" The answer, he said was to embrace developers, ops engineers, and CIOs/CTOs. He emphasized the importance of embracing the power of diversification: "diversity trumps ability." The more experiences, viewpoints, and perspectives that members of the Node community have, the better the outcome for the project itself.

Then he detailed some of the challenges facing people in various roles throughout the enterprise: developers, ops engineers, and executives.
