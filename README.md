notes and links from the conference


#### James Snell
(IBM’s open technologies architect)

First off was James Snell from IBM, with a presentation titled “Convergence: Evolving Node.js with Open Governance and an Open Community.” Snell is IBM’s open technologies architect, and a member of the Node Core Technical Committee (CTC) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). He observed that 2015 was an interesting year for Node, with the io.js fork generating some fear, doubt, and uncertainty.  Although there was a lot of excitement around Node, he said, there was a general belief that it could be better.

With the release of Node.js v4.0.0, the node.js and io.js projects resolved their differences and came back together. During the talk, he explored the events that led up to convergence, discussed how the Node.js project has evolved, and gave insight as to how developers can get involved to help the Node.js core continue to grow and mature.

#### Jason Gartner
(vice-president of Interactive Services development at IBM)

The next speaker was Jason Gartner, vice-president of Interactive Services development at IBM, with a talk entitled “The World is being reinvented in code.” He started with a question: Why is IBM interested in Node, and how are we taking it forward? The answer, in a word (or rather, an acronym) is APIs. According to polls, the top use cases for Node are REST APIs and realtime services.

The next killer app, he said, isn’t going to be an app, its going to be an API, specifically a REST API. Every company is transforming into a digital business for which APIs are critically important to interact with customers, vendors, partners, and more. IBM refers to this as the “API economy.” By 2018, he said, the API economy will be worth $2.2 trillion.
