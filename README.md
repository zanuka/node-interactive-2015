#### James Snell
(IBM’s open technologies architect)

First off was James Snell from IBM, with a presentation titled “Convergence: Evolving Node.js with Open Governance and an Open Community.” Snell is IBM’s open technologies architect, and a member of the Node Core Technical Committee (CTC) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). He observed that 2015 was an interesting year for Node, with the io.js fork generating some fear, doubt, and uncertainty.  Although there was a lot of excitement around Node, he said, there was a general belief that it could be better.

With the release of Node.js v4.0.0, the node.js and io.js projects resolved their differences and came back together. During the talk, he explored the events that led up to convergence, discussed how the Node.js project has evolved, and gave insight as to how developers can get involved to help the Node.js core continue to grow and mature.

Even more exciting is what’s happening in the ecosystem: npm module counts started increasing and npm downloads have gone up dramatically. Snell finished by saying he’s excited to see how people leverage Node to build great things in the coming year.

The next speaker was Jason Gartner, vice-president of Interactive Services development at IBM, with a talk entitled “The World is being reinvented in code.” He started with a question: Why is IBM interested in Node, and how are we taking it forward? The answer, in a word (or rather, an acronym) is APIs. According to polls, the top use cases for Node are REST APIs and realtime services.

The next killer app, he said, isn’t going to be an app, its going to be an API, specifically a REST API. Every company is transforming into a digital business for which APIs are critically important to interact with customers, vendors, partners, and more. IBM refers to this as the “API economy.” By 2018, he said, the API economy will be worth $2.2 trillion.

### IBM's focus on Node.js in 2015
- Acquiring StrongLoop.
- Continuing its support of the Node developer community.
- Working to bring Java and Node communities together to promote innovation.
- Expanding the number connectors to legacy systems where data currently resides.
- Making Node solutions available on IBM Bluemix and projects from Bluemix garage.

# Node.js at Uber
Tom Croucher - engineering manager, Uber

Tom spoke about his experiences using Node at Uber. He started by saying he likes the amount of power Node gives him and the things it enables him to do quickly and easily. Then he noted that the bulk of Uber’s $50 billion business is based on Node.js technology. Uber works because it’s a platform, he said, and that is largely enabled by Node.

He said “Let’s be real: Node is just an event loop with bits of JavaScript bolted on.”

He recommended that everyone read Steve Yegge’s “platform rant” from 2001 that compares how things are done at Google and Amazon.

He also noted that Uber loves open source and contributing to the open source community. See http://uber.github.io/ for a list of projects.
